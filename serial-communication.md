# Serial communication
The communication between LCD and motor controller is a simple serial TTL-level connection with a baudrate of 9600.
For each direction (motor to LCD / LCD to motor), There is one data message/packet format, that is repeated multiple times per second.

## Motor to LCD
Example message:
```
43 00 01 51 51 00 07 07 F4
```
Send frequency: 8 per second

## Details
### Motor status flags

Bit | description
--- | -----------
\#0 | low voltage
\#1 | unknown
\#2 | motor running (if not in speed limit)
\#3 | PAS status / pedals spinning

### Motor control flags

Bit | description
--- | -----------
\#0 | headlight
\#1 | assist level 2
\#2 | assist level 3
\#3 | assist level 4
\#4 | assist off
\#5 | 6kph mode
\#6 | assist level 1
\#7 | hidden/unused assist level below level 1

### Wheel size
Wheel size in inch, e.g. 0x1C in decimal are 28inch   
Controller probably only uses values between 6 and 29 inch.
Firmware default (without LCD) is 0x1a / 26 inch.
### Maximum speed
Speed in kph, e.g. 0x1B in decimal is 27kph   
If a value below 0x0e (14kph) is sent to the controller, it uses the default value 0x19 (25kph) instead.
### Pedal torque
#### first byte / "tara" value:
The torque sensor is read when motor is powered on.  
This value is used as reference to detect if force is applied to the pedals.  
Value can change a little bit after a stop.
#### second byte / current value:
This is the current value of the sensor.  
To get the applied force, you have to subtract the first byte / "tara" value.

The exact conversion factor has to be tested.   
The value increases by about 2.7 for every kg added load on a pedal at a pedal arm length of 17cm length.
That should be about 3.6 Nm per unit on the axis?

### Battery level
Calculated based on the setting in the [EEPROM](eeprom.md)

value | voltage (36V) | display
----- | ------------- | -------
00 | ≈33V | red and blinking
01 | ≈34V | 1 red bar
02-09 |  | green range
0A | >=38V | full
Though the motor sends values above 0A, the LCD doesn't show any difference, just green and full.

### Speed
The speed is basically a 16bit integer that contains the time between two trigger events of the speed sensor = one rotation.   
Each unit stands for about 2.04 ms time.   
Example calculation:
```
28 inch wheel = 2.24 m per rotation
Value: "89 01" = 0x0189 = 393 units
Time per ration: 393 units * 2.04 ms = 801.72 ms
Rotations per second: 1000 ms / 801.72 ms = 1.247 rotations/second
Speed: 1.247 rotations/second * 2.24 m per rotation = 2.79 m/s * 3.6 = 10kph
```
When standing still, the motor sends the maximum value "07 07" (0x0707 / 1799), so like it would be ≈3.6 seconds.   
The LCD already ignores values above 1750 / 0x6d6.

### Checksum
The checksum is basically the sum of previous bytes as 8bit unsigned integer.
